                <p>
                    There are so many reasons why I chose to be software engineer. In my previous careers - a whole
                    lifetime
                    ago - I didn't feel like I was using my brain to it's full potential. When I was introduced to
                    programming, I found a world where I could flex and grow my muscles of creativity and imagination.
                    What's more, is that I could instantly see the fruit of my own creation.

                    An internship at Lob would be an incredible opportunity to grow my knowledge of API development and
                    continue on in my journey of self development. In particular, travel has always been a major part of
                    my
                    life. When I lived in Thailand, knowledge of legitimate addresses was integral to me receiving my
                    medicine on a monthly basis. Address validation is a world I would love to contribute to.
